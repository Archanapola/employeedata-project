## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Archanapola/EmployeeData.git
cd EmployeeData

2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use 'myenv\Scripts\activate'

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you haven't already installed Faker, you can manually install it with:

pip install faker

4. Configure the Database
In settings.py, ensure your database is properly configured. The default setup is for MySQL. Hereâ€™s an example:

python
Copy code
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'employeedb',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password_here',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}

5. Apply Migrations
Run migrations to set up your database schema:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

6. Create a Superuser
   
Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:
python manage.py createsuperuser

7. Generate Fake Data

To generate fake employee data, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/data/ to populate your database with 10 random employee records.

8. Running the Development Server
